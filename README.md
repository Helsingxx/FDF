This is a rendition of the 42school project FDF.

This projects uses the mlx library to display a graphical window in which an inputed file is traced line by line to showcase the Fil-de-Fer method of drawing.

This project was meant to familiarize me with elementary concepts of 3d computer graphics as well as the usage of GUI libraries.
